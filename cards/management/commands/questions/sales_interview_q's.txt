1. Tell me about a time you successfully grew a client base. What strategies did you use?
- Example Answer: At Ignite Tennis, I grew the client base from zero to over 150 weekly participants. The key strategy I used was focusing on personalised communication and building a strong sense of community. I implemented a CRM system to manage client interactions, ensuring that each customer received tailored follow-up emails and reminders about upcoming sessions. Additionally, I launched targeted marketing campaigns on social media and collaborated with local schools to host events that introduced potential clients to the club. These strategies helped increase sign-ups, and the personal connection we created led to high retention rates.

2. How would you apply your experience in CRM system implementation to a sales software role?
- Example Answer: In both GForce and Ignite Tennis, I designed and implemented customised CRM systems to manage client bookings, payments, and communications. This experience taught me the importance of having an efficient system to track client interactions and streamline operations. In a sales software role, I would leverage this knowledge to help potential clients understand how a CRM can not only organise their customer data but also drive sales growth by automating follow-ups, improving client retention, and providing data-driven insights to personalise outreach.

3. How do you handle objections or challenges when negotiating with a client? Can you give an example?
- Example Answer: At GForce, I often negotiated with clients and business partners regarding event pricing and sponsorship deals. One memorable situation was when a potential sponsor hesitated to invest due to concerns about the event’s reach. To overcome this, I presented data from past events, showing attendee growth and social media engagement metrics. I also proposed a tiered sponsorship package that allowed them to start at a lower investment level with the option to scale up. This solution addressed their budget concerns and gave them flexibility. As a result, they agreed to sponsor the event, and we built a long-term partnership.

4. How does your technical background in Python and SQL help you understand software products from a sales perspective?
- Example Answer: My technical background in Python and SQL allows me to deeply understand how software products function behind the scenes. For instance, in my role as a Junior Data Engineer, I built data pipelines and worked with databases like MongoDB, which gave me insight into how data is stored, processed, and retrieved efficiently. This technical knowledge helps me communicate the value of software solutions to clients, especially when they need to understand how a product can improve their workflow or integrate with their existing systems. I can explain the technical aspects in simple terms, ensuring the client understands the benefits without feeling overwhelmed.

5. Can you explain how you would pitch a CRM system to a client?
- Example Answer: When pitching a CRM system, I would start by asking the client about their current pain points regarding managing customer interactions. Once I understand their challenges, I’d explain how a CRM can streamline their processes. For example, I’d highlight how the system can automate follow-ups with clients, segment customer lists for targeted marketing, and provide detailed insights into customer behaviour. I’d also share how, at GForce, our CRM system increased efficiency by 25%, allowing us to manage bookings and communications seamlessly. Lastly, I’d offer a demonstration to show how easy it is to use and customise according to their specific needs.

6. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest trends in software sales?
- Example Answer: I actively follow industry news and trends through online platforms like LinkedIn, as well as specialised forums and communities. I also subscribe to newsletters from leading sales and tech blogs to stay informed about new developments. Recently, I’ve been completing certifications, such as the HubSpot Sales Software Certification, to stay current with the latest software tools and sales techniques. This continuous learning allows me to adapt quickly to new tools and industry demands, ensuring I can effectively sell cutting-edge solutions.

7. Can you describe a time when you identified a major inefficiency and took steps to solve it?
- Example Answer: At GForce, I noticed that our client booking and payment systems were disconnected, causing confusion and inefficiency. Clients had to book through one platform and pay separately, leading to errors and delays. To address this, I designed and implemented a fully customised CRM system that integrated bookings, payments, and client communications into one platform. This streamlined the process, reduced errors, and significantly improved client satisfaction. As a result, we saw a 25% increase in bookings within three months. My ability to identify inefficiencies and implement tech solutions has been key to driving business growth.

8. How would you handle a situation where a customer is hesitant to adopt new technology?
- Example Answer: I’d start by understanding their concerns—whether it’s about cost, complexity, or disruption to their current workflow. I’d then address these concerns by demonstrating how the new technology can solve their specific pain points. For example, when I introduced a CRM system at GForce, some team members were hesitant because they were used to manual processes. I arranged a series of training sessions and demonstrated how the system would save them time by automating tasks. Once they saw the benefits in action, their resistance dropped. In sales, I would use a similar approach, offering demonstrations, case studies, or a trial period to help the client feel confident about the change.

9. How do you balance technical knowledge with customer empathy in a sales environment?
- Example Answer: Balancing technical knowledge with customer empathy is crucial in sales. I start by truly listening to the customer’s needs and concerns, making sure I fully understand their pain points. Once I have that understanding, I introduce the technical aspects of the product, but I always frame them in the context of how they solve the client’s problems. For example, when discussing a CRM system, instead of focusing on the software’s technical specifications, I focus on how it will make their day-to-day work easier, save them time, and improve their client relationships. I ensure the conversation stays customer-centric, addressing their concerns while showing the solution’s value.

10. How did you build and maintain strong relationships with clients at Ignite Tennis and GForce?
- Example Answer: At both Ignite Tennis and GForce, building and maintaining strong relationships was a priority. I did this by ensuring regular, personalised communication with clients. For example, I used the CRM systems I implemented to send personalised follow-up emails and reminders about upcoming sessions. I also hosted community events to create a sense of belonging and give clients a reason to stay engaged. Additionally, I made sure to address any feedback or concerns promptly, ensuring clients felt heard and valued.
